                <h2>About Edmonton Gallery Walk</h2>
                <p>The Edmonton Gallery Walk, continuing a tradition that began in 1981, promotes art and artists within our community, focusing especially on work by Canadian artists.</p>
                
                <p>The Gallery Walk is located <span class="highlight">west of the downtown core in the 124 Street area</span>, a vital business community with many quality restaurants, gift and clothing shops, bookstores, live theatre venues and specialty businesses in its <span class="highlight">two block area</span>.</p>
                
                <p>Although formal unguided Gallery Walks are planned <span class="highlight">three times per year</span>, we encourage group walks throughout the year, and will be happy to assist in the planning of any gallery walk for schools, conventions, or groups in general.</p>
                
                <p><span class="highlight">Please contact any of the member galleries</span> if you are planning a visit to find out specific information about upcoming exhibitions.</p>
